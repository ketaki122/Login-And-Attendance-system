# About The Project
  <p align = "center">
    <p>
 This new form of attendance system will greatly reduce the workload of the faculty members and save the extra time and efforts needed to file and manually update the months and months of attendance records of individual students.
It also helps in reducing the amount of errors caused during manually updating the attendance from one file to another making the ‘Attendance System’ a very efficient means.
